Speaking about the renewable energy project in the North African country, Youssef Chahed, the prime minister of Tunisia, said that the project will be situated in the regions of Kairouan, Tozeur, Tataouine, Sidi Bouzid, Kebeli and Tataouine, cited the source. However, any further details to the story were not provided. This wind and solar project is in line with Tunisia’s goal to develop more renewable energy projects in the country, to ensure adequate energy supply to its citizens. This follows the country’s pledge in the last month to invest US$1.78bn to develop renewable energy projects for a period of next two years. The biggest investment is expected to be made in the sector of solar power, said the source. In an attempt to increase electricity production for domestic consumption as well as export to the international markets, particularly in Europe, Tunisia has invested about US$4.96bn for energy projects, which include both increasing power generation capacities and upgradation electricity grids in the country by the end of 2020. In addition to this, the country is close to build a 4.5 GW solar export project in the Sahara Desert in Southwest Tunisia, which is believed to be the largest solar power plant in the world. British company TuNur Limited is waiting for an authorisation approval from the Tunisian Ministry of Energy, Mines and Renewable Energy, after which the solar park will be exporting electricity to the major European markets.
