ENGIE Africa expands its footprint in West Africa by acquiring two companies, namely Afric Power and Tieri, specialising in energy services in the region. The energy solutions provider noted that the companies based in Côte d’Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, have been able to export their competencies throughout the region.  Afric Power and Tieri are complementary companies offering a comprehensive service including system design, the assembly of electrical cabinets and automated control mechanisms, and the installation, maintenance and warranty coverage of equipment. The companies have forged strong partnerships with customers operating in many sectors, such as agro-industry, agri-food, mines, large-scale services and data centres.
