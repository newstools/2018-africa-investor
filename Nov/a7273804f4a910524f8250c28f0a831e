Julius Berger, a construction company in Nigeria has given the Senate committee on work an assurance that Lagos-Ibadan road will be completed by 2021. The company who made the revelations during a meeting with Senator Kabiru Gaya-led Senate committee which also involved inspection on roads projects currently, pointed out that completion of the project, which was earlier slated for 2017 could not be materialized due to lack of funds and some expansions. Construction sites visited by the senator and his members were the 1.5km NNPC Mosimi Access road said to be stalled by N1bn debt, the Apapa Wharf road which is under the construction of AG Dangote and the Leventis bridge which are expected to be completed before the end of 2018 and the first quarters of 2019 respectively. Senator Gaya however expressed disappointment with the delay trailing the project.  He added that with the federal government’s increase in funds marked for road construction, there should not be any delay in the project. “The project is good as it will take care of traffic but we are not happy with the speed and so we expect the contractor to increase the pace of work, even though there were amendments on the road,” said Senator Gaya. The senator disclosed that the cost of road infrastructure has been increased by the federal government from US $1.3 to US $1.6m and Apapa Wharf road project, currently 97% complete would be finished in December 2018.
