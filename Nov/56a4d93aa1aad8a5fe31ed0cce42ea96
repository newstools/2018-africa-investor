Angola is set to receive US $51m boost from the British government to build three hospitals and upgrade two power stations in the country. Baroness Northover, the prime minister’s trade envoy for Angola and Zambia  confirmed the reports and said the deal will enable to enter a global marketplace and deliver reliable power to millions of people in Angola and also showcase British expertise in the development of vital healthcare services. “I have visited Angola regularly in the last two years in support of UK- Angola business co-operation, and am acutely aware of the growing opportunities there. It is wonderful that these important projects have come to fruition and I look forward to seeing more in the future,” said Baroness Northover.
