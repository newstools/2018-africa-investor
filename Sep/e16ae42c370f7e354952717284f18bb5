Italy aims to be China’s leading economic and trade partner in Europe and is open to becoming a Mediterranean transport hub for Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative, the country’s undersecretary of state for economic development said in an interview with Caixin. “We are exploring the possibility of having closer cooperation and for Italy to be the leader in Europe in the relationship with China,” Michele Geraci told Caixin. He spoke during a 10-day visit to China from late August to early September. Geraci was heading the first official mission of the new Italian coalition government’s Task Force China, a program unveiled late last month with a goal to enhance relations in the fields of trade, finance, investment, research and development, and co-operation in third countries. The team is also seeking to “guarantee Italy a position of leadership in Europe vis-à-vis China’s Belt and Road and Made in China 2025 initiatives,” the Ministry of Economic Development said in a statement issued at its launch.
