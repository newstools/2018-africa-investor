China Telecom Global (CTG), a subsidiary of China Telecom Corporation Limited – providers of integrated telecommunication services, and Liquid Telecom, a pan-African telecoms group, announced the signing of a historic strategic partnership whereby the two companies will collaborate to provide Africa and Asia with network solutions and services. The agreement will enable both companies to serve their respective enterprise and wholesale customers with extended network coverage across some of the fastest growing economies in the two regions. China Telecom Global has already established a Point-of-Presence (PoP) at Liquid Telecom’s East Africa Data Centre in Nairobi, and will establish further PoPs at its data centre facilities in Johannesburg and Cape Town. CTG and Liquid Telecom will also continue to explore joint service opportunities under the partnership. “With more than 50 countries in the region, Africa is nonetheless the booming new market with the highest development rate just after Asia, and a very important market for CTG. This collaboration will enable both CTG and Liquid Telecom better serve our customers and explore untapped business potential for further development. Under this partnership, we are well positioned to enhance the connectivity and network infrastructure in both regions,” said Changhai Liu, Managing Director of China Telecom (Africa and Middle East) Limited. “This partnership with China Telecom Global reflects the strong global demand for world-class network services across Africa. Our combined service and network capabilities will be of great value to multinationals operating in some of the fastest growing economies across Africa and Asia-Pacific,” said Willem Marais, Group Chief Business Development Officer, Liquid Telecom.
