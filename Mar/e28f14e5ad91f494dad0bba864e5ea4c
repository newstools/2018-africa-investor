The US-based oil and gas firm plans to join companies like Tullow Oil Plc, Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Kosmos Energy Ltd, and CEF (SOC) Ltd in licensing a block. Each of the aforementioned firms is currently participating in four blocks. ExxonMobil has entered the upstream market by pursuing exploration of the Deepwater Cape Three Points block. The data and analytics company, GlobalData, eight ultra-deep water and deep water upstream oil and gas discoveries have been found in the country in the past five years. The depths of the water levels in the fields has varied from as little as 4,920ft to as much as 7,411ft.
